## Did you know that :

- [Deep Inference](http://alessio.guglielmi.name/res/cos/index.html) is very cool.

Among all the things I do to avoid actually doing any meaningful work, I quite enjoy reading, and sometimes writing, <a href="#" onclick="randomPoem();" title="Click for a random poem">poetry</a>.

<div id="poembox" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; text-align: left;">
<i><p id="poemtext">
</p>
<p id="poemauthor"></p>
</i>
</div>
