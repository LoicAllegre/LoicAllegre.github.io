Tools and software I either wrote or contributed to and that could possibly be useful to someone, some day.

## [Epsilon Calculus Translator](https://gitlab.com/loic.allegre/epsilon-calculus-translator)

A command-line tool to translate formulae between first-order logic and the epsilon calculus.  

As I'm sure anyone who has ever tried to write an epsilon-formula with more than two quantifiers will agree, this should represent a non-trivial improvement in writing efficiency and in authors' sanity.

If, however, you really enjoy wasting your days, you can check manually that this [epsilon-translation](/assets/epsilon.txt) indeed corresponds to the formula {::nomarkdown}\(\forall x \exists y \forall z \exists w P(x,y,z,w)\){:/}.
