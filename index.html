<p>Hello !</p>
<p>I am Loïc Allègre, currently a PhD Student under the supervision of <a href="https://www.lirmm.fr/~retore/">Christian Retoré</a>, in the <a href="https://www.lirmm.fr/equipes/TEXTE">TEXTE</a> team at <a href="https://www.lirmm.fr">LIRMM</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.umontpellier.fr/">University of Montpellier</a>.</p>



<p>My research interests broadly revolve around mathematical logic, mainly proof theory and its links to theoretical computer science.</p>
<p>In more practical details, my current work focuses on extensions and variants of quantification in various logical systems and formalisms, notably (but not limited to):

 <ul>
  <li>Hilbert&#39;s Epsilon Calculus</li>
  <li>Generalized Quantifier Theory</li>
  <li>Henkin Quantifiers and other partially-ordered quantification systems</li>
</ul> 
</p>


<p>I am also very interested in the history and philosophy of mathematics, language, and the applications of logic to the study of linguistics.</p>
