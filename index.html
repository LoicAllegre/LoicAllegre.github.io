<p>Hello !</p>
<p>I am Loïc Allègre, currently a PhD Student under the supervision of <a href="https://www.lirmm.fr/~retore/">Christian Retoré</a>, in the <a href="https://www.lirmm.fr/equipes/TEXTE">TEXTE</a> team at <a href="https://www.lirmm.fr">LIRMM</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.umontpellier.fr/">University of Montpellier</a>.</p>



<p>My research interests are centered around mathematical logic, mainly proof theory and its links to theoretical computer science.</p>
<p>More specifically, my work focuses on extensions and variants of quantification in various logical systems and formalisms, notably (but not limited to) Hilbert&#39;s Epsilon Calculus and generalized quantifiers.</p>
<p>I am also a firm believer that <a href="http://alessio.guglielmi.name/res/cos/index.html">Deep Inference</a> is very cool. <img float="left" width="40" src='/assets/proof_frog.jpg'></p>
